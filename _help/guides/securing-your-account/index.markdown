# Securing your Minecraft account

Minecraft is a very popular game with a very lot of players, and a lot of demand for stolen accounts. As such, Minecraft accounts often get stolen, but there are some things you can do to help prevent it from happening to yours.

## Piracy, Account Sharing, and secondhand accounts
Many people in their past days resorted to piracy if they couldn't afford to purchase Minecraft. Some eventually bought a propper account and some may still pirate.

If you have pirated Minecraft before, you should understand that if someone is giving you something for free, most likely they're only doing it so that they can make money off you later. 

Piracy tools work by redirecting requests to Mojang's Authentication servers to their own and tricking the launcher into thinking you own the game. Unfortunately, this means that if you buy a proper account and log in with your account before switching back to Mojang's authentication servers, you've just sent your email and password to a server run by pirates, and many of them will use that information to steal your account and resell it. If you've used piracy tools in the past you should follow [this guide](/_help/hosts-file/index.markdown) to ensure they have been fully removed from your system.

Account sharing, where you give your account details to a friend or family member so that they can play for free, is also against Mojang's End User License Agreement (EULA) and Terms. As well as this, it also poses multiple security risks, because:

- Anyone with your email password can take your account away from you.
- If your friends/family don't take the same security precautions as you and get hacked, your account might get stolen.

Accounts bought from websites other than minecraft.net and Amazon also pose a risk, because they don't come with a Transaction ID as proof of purchase, which means that if you do get hacked, it is unlikely that Mojang Support will be able to recover your account. In addition, the account may be stolen from someone else or the person or website who sold you the account may have the Transaction ID, meaning it could be taken away from you at any time. Buying accounts from websites other than minecraft.net and Amazon is also a violation of Mojang's EULA and TOS, meaning there is a small chance of your account being banned.

## Using a Microsoft account
In October 2020, Mojang announced that they would be using Microsoft accounts for Java Edition going forward. This is a good thing, because Microsoft accounts are far more secure than Mojang accounts, offer 2-Factor Authentication, and are easier to recover due to Microsoft's larger support system.

At the time of writing, all purchases of Java Edition made after December 1st, 2020 are linked to Microsoft accounts, and existing Mojang accounts will likely be able to migrate soon. If you are able to migrate, you should strongly consider doing so, and if you already use a Microsoft account to log in, you should [enable two-factor authentication](https://minecrafthopper.net) for extra security.

## Password Security
Having a good password is arguably the most important step in having a secure account, especially on Mojang accounts, where there is no two-factor authentication and the password is by far the most important defence.

Any strong password you choose should meet all these requirements:

- It should be long (at least 10-12 characters), and have letters and numbers in it (symbols and punctuation aren't so important)
- It should be one that you don't use on other websites. If another website you use gets hacked and your password there is stolen, all the other accounts you have with that password are at risk too.
- It shouldn't contain any information such as your favourite food, your pet's name, or the town where you grew up. Anyone trying to hack you could potentially look up this information on your social media accounts and guess the password easily.

One of the easiest ways of making strong passwords is using a password manager, as they can generate strong passwords for you and store them securely so that you don't have to remember them all. Many browsers come with these built-in, but if you want to share your passwords between browsers or operating systems, the best option is [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/download/) as the basic version is free and has very few limits for the average person, and it supports all major browsers and operating systems.

## Email Security
Another step in securing your account is ensuring that your email account is secure. This is especially important, as anyone with access to your email account can request a password reset for any account you own (not just Minecraft), and they can also steal your Transaction ID if it's still in your email.

To make sure your email is secure, you should make sure you have a strong password (see above) although note that it's not a very good idea to keep your email account password in a password manager; because of how you may need to access your emails even when you can't access your password manager.

In addition, you should strongly consider turning on 2-Factor Authentication on your email account:

- [Protect your Google account with 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839)
- [Enabling 2-Factor Authentication on your Microsoft account](https://minecrafthopper.net) (MinecraftHopper guide)
- [Add two-step verification to your Yahoo account for extra security](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN5013.html)
- [Add two-step verification to your AOL for extra security](https://help.aol.com/articles/2-step-verification-stronger-than-your-password-alone)

If you don't use any of these providers, check your provider's support website for instructions on how to enable 2-Factor Authentication.

## Having a good antivirus
Having a good antivirus is important, not only to protect your Minecraft account but to keep your computer safe and running smoothly. The best antivirus currently available is [Malwarebytes](https://malwarebytes.com), and you get its full scanning capability for free as well (you can pay a small monthly fee for scheduled scans). It's available for both Windows and macOS.

## Security Questions
While Mojang accounts do not offer 2-Factor Authentication, they do offer security questions, which is the next best thing. To set security questions, you can go to https://account.mojang.com/me/settings. For extra security, you can give false answers (for example, you could say your first pet was named Hedwig), so that any hacker who knows the password and the real answers will still be unable to access your account.
