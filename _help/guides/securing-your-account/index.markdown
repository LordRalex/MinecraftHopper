# Securing your Minecraft account

Minecraft is a very popular game with a very lot of players, and a lot of demand for stolen accounts. As such, Minecraft accounts often get stolen, but there are some things you can do to help prevent it from happening to yours.

## Piracy
Many people in their past days resorted to piracy if they couldn't afford to purchase Minecraft. Some eventually bought a propper account, and some may still pirate.

If you have pirated Minecraft before, you should understand that if someone is giving you something they stole for free, most likely they're only doing it so that they can make money off you later. 

Piracy tools work by redirecting requests to Mojang's authentication servers to their own and tricking the launcher into thinking you own the game. Unfortunately, this means that if you buy a proper account and log in with your account before switching back to Mojang's authentication servers, you've just sent your email and password to a server run by pirates, and many of them will use that information to steal your account and resell it. If you've used piracy tools in the past you should follow [this guide](/_help/hosts-file/index.markdown) to ensure they have been fully removed from your system.

## Account Sharing
Account sharing, where you give your account details to a friend or family member so that they can play for free, is also against Mojang's End User License Agreement (EULA) and Terms. As well as this, it poses multiple security risks, because:

- Anyone with your email and password can take your account away from you.
- If your friends/family don't take the same security precautions as you and they get hacked, your account might get stolen.

# Secondhand Accounts
    Accounts bought from websites other than minecraft.net and Amazon are also risky, because buying them (or any account from a website other than minecraft.net, Amazon or a physical store) is a violation of Mojang's EULA and TOS, meaning that Mojang will not help you recover your account if lose it, even with the Transaction ID.  In addition, the account may have been stolen from someone else, who may claim it back and take it away from you; or the person or website who sold you the account claim it back with Mojang's help, since it still belongs to them in Mojang's eyes.

## Using a Microsoft account
In October 2020, Mojang announced that they would be using Microsoft accounts for Java Edition going forward. This is a good thing, because Microsoft accounts are far more secure than Mojang accounts, offer 2-Factor Authentication, and are easier to recover due to Microsoft's larger support system.

At the time of writing, all purchases of Java Edition made after December 1st, 2020 are linked to Microsoft accounts, and existing Mojang accounts are being migrated bit by bit. If you are not yet able to migrate, you will get a notification in the launcher when your account is ready to be migrated, and if you are able to migrate, you should strongly consider doing so. If you use a Microsoft account to log in, you should [enable two-factor authentication](/_help/about-two-factor-authentication) for extra security.

## Password Security
Having a good password is arguably the most important step in having a secure account, especially on Mojang accounts, where there is no two-factor authentication and so the password is by far the most important defence.

Any strong password you choose should meet all these requirements:

- It should be long (at least 10-12 characters), and have letters and numbers in it (symbols and punctuation aren't so important)
- It should be one that you don't use on other websites. If another website you use gets hacked and your password there is stolen, all the other accounts you have with that password are at risk too.
- It shouldn't contain any information such as your favourite food, your pet's name, or the town where you grew up. Anyone trying to hack you could potentially look up this information on your social media accounts and guess the password easily.

One of the easiest ways of making strong passwords is using a password manager, as they can generate strong passwords for you and store them securely so that you don't have to remember them all. Many browsers come with these built-in, but if you want to share your passwords between browsers or operating systems, the best free option is [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/download/) as the free version has very few limits for the average person, and it supports all major browsers and operating systems.

## Email Security
Another step in securing your account is ensuring that your email account is secure. This is especially important, as anyone with access to your email account can request a password reset for any account you own (not just Minecraft), and they can also steal your Transaction ID if it's still in your email.

To make sure your email is secure, you should make sure you have a strong password (see above) although note that it's not a very good idea to have your email account password generated by a password manager because you may often need to access your emails even when you can't access your password manager.

In addition, you should strongly consider turning on 2-Factor Authentication on your email account:

- [Protect your Google account with 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839)
- [Enabling 2-Factor Authentication on your Microsoft account](https://minecrafthopper.net) (MinecraftHopper guide)
- [Add two-step verification to your Yahoo account for extra security](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN5013.html)
- [Add two-step verification to your AOL for extra security](https://help.aol.com/articles/2-step-verification-stronger-than-your-password-alone)

If you don't use any of these providers, check your provider's support website for instructions on how to enable 2-Factor Authentication.

## Having a good antivirus
Having a good antivirus is important, not only to protect your Minecraft account but to keep your computer safe and running smoothly. The best antivirus currently available is [Malwarebytes](https://malwarebytes.com), and you get its full scanning capability for free as well (you can pay a small monthly fee for scheduled scans). It's available for both Windows and macOS.

## Security Questions
While Mojang accounts do not offer 2-Factor Authentication, they do offer security questions, which is the next best thing. To set security questions, you can go to [https://account.mojang.com/me/settings](https://account.mojang.com/me/settings). For extra security, you can give false answers (for example, you could say your favourite ice-cream flavour), so that any hacker who knows the password and the real answers will still be unable to access your account.

If you've made it to the end and followed all the advice, your account is now as secure as it can be. But no account will ever be completely free of danger, so make sure to always use common sense, and make sure to only visit links or download files that you trust. You should also [find or recover your Transaction ID](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360029977371) if you can, so that you'll have it if you ever need to contact Mojang Support.
