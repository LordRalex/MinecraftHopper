# Getting Minecraft Logs <small>(Java Only)</small>

The Minecraft launcher keeps logs of game events as they happen which can be useful for debugging errors or other issues that may occur within the game. There are five types of logs that can be obtained:

* Game Output
* Launcher Log
* Latest Log
* Crash Report
* JVM Crash Report

Follow the relevant directions below to obtain these log files from Minecraft. **Be sure you follow the instructions for the type of log you are asked to get.**

#### Step 1

[Open the .minecraft folder.](/help/finding-minecraft-data-folder/)
![](/static/images/help/guides/getting-minecraft-logs/minecraft-folder-hs_err.png)

#### Step 2

Look for a file beginning with *hs_err_pid*. There could be multiple such files, so we need to idenitfy which one to get:
* If there is only one such file, continue with Step 3 using that file.
* If whoever requested this report told you what the file name is, use that one, and continue with Step 3 using that file.
* Otherwise, open *launcher_log* or *launcher_log.txt*. Go to the end of the file, and scroll up through the file until you see the following section in the image below. The file name is outlined by the red box. Locate the file with that name and continue with Step 3.
