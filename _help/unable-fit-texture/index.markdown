# Unable to fit texture
This crash is caused by Minecraft being unable to handle a texture, due to insufficient video memory.

Common workarounds include reverting to the default resource pack, disabling Anisotropic Filtering or allocating more memory to the game.

### How to fix this

#### Switch to the default resource pack
1. Go to the [Minecraft folder](/hopper/finding-minecraft-data-folder/)
2. Open `options.txt`
3. Change the line that starts with `resourcepacks:` to `resourcepacks:[]`
4. Save and close the file
5. Run Minecraft normally

#### Give Minecraft more memory
Your computer may not have enough memory available for this option, follow [this guide](/help/out-of-memory/).
